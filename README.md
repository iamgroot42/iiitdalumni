IIITD Alumni Website

Home page : consists of recent news,activities and events (a carousel,maybe? ).The following links are present on the home page:
-About IIITD AA
-Groups/Fora
-News (seems redundant,as it is already present in the news feed)
-Showcase
-Contact
-Profile (on logging in)
-Account settings (on logging in)
Along with these, we have a user-login/signup button opening a login-window (in a modal). A search bar for looking up people would be nice.

On the footer, we have home, top of page, about, contact, IIITD website, copyright statement.
